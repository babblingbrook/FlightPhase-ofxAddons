ofxSlitScan.h

ofxSlitScan is a simple utility for creating slit scan
effects and video time delays. It works by keeping a 
rolling buffer of video frames that can be sampled
from arbitrarly via a warp map 

For inspiring works using this effect, check out Golen Leven's page
on Slit Scan artworks

http://www.flong.com/texts/lists/slit_scan/
Usage:

First call set up with the width and height that matches the video you want to process
after calling setup, use any image to set the delay map 
then with every incoming frame call addImage();
Calling getOutputImage will return a reference to the warped / delayed video frame
